# How to use

1. Download the ***NDS_MinUI.zip*** file in the [Releases](https://github.com/Vidnez/Nintendo-DS-PAK-for-RGB30/releases) section.
2. Unzip the ***NDS_MinUI.zip*** file.
3. Copy ***NDS.pak*** into the ***/Emus/rgb30*** folder on the SD card in slot 2.
4. Copy ***Drastic filter.pak*** into the ***/Tools/rgb30*** folder on the SD card in slot 2.
5. Create a folder named ***"Nintendo DS (NDS)"*** (without the quotes) inside the ***/Roms*** folder on the SD card in slot 2, where you will place the ROMs in .nds format.
6. Launch the game from the MinUI menu. The pack will create and save your game saves and save states in the ***/Saves/NDS*** folder.

> [!TIP]
> To switch between ***Nearest Neighbor*** and ***Bilinear filter + LCD grid effect*** run ***Drastic filter*** from the Tools menu in MinUI.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The PAK can only use two layouts at a time. By default, when you first launch the PAK, the layouts ***bg_vertical_ext.png*** and ***bg_vertical.png*** are copied to the root of the SD card in slot 2 for use. If you want to change this, refer to the image below and select two layouts from the ***layouts*** folder included in the zip file. Then, replace the two files in the root of the SD card in slot 2 with the two layouts you want.
